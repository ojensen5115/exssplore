# eXSSplore

This tool is useful when you wish to exploit an XSS vulnerability on a site whose structure you do not know.
Load the viewer page and wait for your victim to hit your payload.
Once connected, the site will load in the viewer and you'll be able to navigate the site graphically and learn its structure.
